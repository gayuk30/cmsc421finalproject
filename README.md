# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run the Project Locally

In the project directory within a termial, you first have to run:

### `npm i` or `npm install` 

This will install any dependencies you need to make the program run successfully

Next, you would have to run:
### `npm start`

This will run the program on a localhost port. 
Usually it would be on localhost:3000 but incase of any changes the terminal will display it. 
Also, the page will reload when you make changes to the code to show the changes on the actual web app.

Note: To change the actual look and functionality of the app, you would have to go into components and modify the according .js and .css files!
Note: To change the routing, you would have to modify the App.js file!
### `npm run build` 

This is for when you want to deploy your app after all changes have been made and you are satisfied with the final product
