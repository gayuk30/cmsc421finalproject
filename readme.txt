TLDW: Too Long, Didn't Watch
CMSC 421: Final project
This is a learning tool that summarizes youtube videos, generates questions, and identifies keywords with related resources.


To simplify the installation process, I have included all installations into a file called libraries.txt. To install them:
'pip install -r libraries.txt'


How to run the project?
cd the project
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd flask_app
Enter: flask run
This should take you to the site.
